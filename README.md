# ORDERM8
This is the ORDERM8 project.

ORDERM8 is a lightweight software designed for keeping track of delivery customers. 

each customer entered into the ORDERM8 database has a customer page, where their basic information, delivery preferences, and food preferences are displayed.

ORDERM8 also currently has daily customer tracking amd daily task tracking on the homepage. 

the purpose of this version of ORDERM8 is to quickly and roughly try new features. Once a robust set of features is developed in concept, they will be put together in a better organized, and nicer looking, ORDERM8 V2.

To run ORDERM8, navigate to the main ORDERM8 directory and run ORDERM8.py.
